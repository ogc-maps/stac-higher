/**
 * GET /api/assets/{collection}/{item}/{asset} — asset access (ROADMAP §3, Phase 3).
 *
 * Item asset hrefs point here rather than at storage directly, so the catalog
 * stays stable even if storage moves and every download passes an access check.
 * The `{asset}` segment is the stored object's filename.
 *
 * Flow: authorize → resolve the redirect target (presigned canonical URL today;
 * `reference`-mode source in Phase 4) → 302. GET is not gated by the middleware
 * (only mutations are), so the authorization check lives here.
 *
 * Authorization: the caller must be authenticated. Per-collection/group
 * authorization for reads depends on the read-visibility mapping deferred with
 * ADR 0002 (Phase 1 carry-forward); until then authentication is the boundary,
 * and in dev-bypass mode the static identity satisfies it so local flows work.
