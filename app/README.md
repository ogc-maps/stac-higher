# STAC Higher

A modern web interface for browsing, searching, and managing SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC). Full CRUD for collections, items, and assets with interactive map visualization.

<!-- Add a screenshot here: ![STAC Higher Dashboard](docs/screenshot.png) -->

## Features

### Catalog Management
- **Collections**: Create, view, edit, and delete STAC collections with form validation
- **Items**: Full CRUD with geometry drawing (polygon, rectangle, point), dynamic properties, and asset management
- **Assets**: Add, edit, and delete collection-level and item-level assets
- **Bulk Import**: Paste a JSON array of items and import them with a live progress bar
- **Live JSON Preview**: See the STAC-compliant JSON update in real time as you fill out forms

### Map Visualization
- Interactive maps on collection detail (spatial extent), item detail (geometry footprint), item list (all footprints), and search results
- Geometry drawing tools with polygon, bounding box, and point modes
- Interactive bbox drawing on the collection form for defining spatial extents
- Theme-aware basemaps (CartoDB dark-matter / positron) that switch with the app theme
- Hover-to-highlight: mousing over an item card highlights its footprint on the map

### Search
- Cross-collection search via POST /search
- Filter by collection (multi-select), temporal range, spatial bbox, and CQL2-Text expressions
- Results rendered on a full-page map with a responsive sidebar

### Multi-API Support
- Connect to multiple STAC API catalogs
- Switch between catalogs from the header — cached data refreshes automatically
- Test connection button to verify API availability
- Catalog configuration persisted to localStorage
- **CORS Proxy**: Enable per-catalog server-side proxying to reach APIs that don't send CORS headers. Requests are routed through `/api/proxy` on the Astro server, so the browser never touches the remote origin directly.

### Extension Management
- Browse, create, edit, and delete custom STAC extension definitions stored in a local PostgreSQL database
- **Dynamic forms**: When an extension is attached to a collection or item, its JSON Schema fields render as a live form (via RJSF with shadcn/ui widgets) — no manual property entry needed
- **Import external extensions**: Paste any STAC extension schema URL (or pick from the curated list: EO, SAR, View, Projection, Timestamps) to import it locally
- **Schema hosting**: Every local extension is served as a JSON Schema at `/api/extensions/{id}/schema` — usable as a `stac_extensions` URL
- Extension properties flow through to `item.properties` (items) and `summaries` (collections)

### UX
- Dark and light themes with system preference detection
- Responsive layouts (search page stacks on mobile)
- Token-based pagination for item lists
- Page-specific loading skeletons
- Toast notifications for all mutations
- Keyboard navigation and aria-labels on interactive elements
- React error boundaries for graceful failure handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22.12.0
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose (for the STAC API backend and the extension database)

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://username:password@localhost:5433/postgis` | PostgreSQL connection string for extension storage |

The database is provided by the included docker-compose setup. For production, set `DATABASE_URL` to point at your PostgreSQL instance. The app runs schema migrations automatically on the first request.

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd stac-higher

# Start the STAC API backend + PostgreSQL database
docker compose up -d

# Install frontend dependencies
cd app
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

The frontend starts at [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321). The STAC API runs at [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).

On first launch, go to the Catalogs page and add `http://localhost:8082` as your STAC catalog. From there you can create collections, add items, search, and manage extensions.

### Storybook

The shared component library lives in `packages/shared/` and has its own Storybook:

```bash
cd packages/shared
npm run storybook        # http://localhost:6006
npm run build-storybook  # static build to packages/shared/storybook-static/
```

## Scripts

All scripts run from the `app/` directory.

| Script | Command | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dev server | `npm run dev` | Start Astro dev server at localhost:4321 |
| Build | `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/` |
| Preview | `npm run preview` | Preview the production build |
| Type check | `npx astro check` | Run TypeScript type checking |
| Unit tests | `npm test` | Run Vitest unit tests |
| Unit tests (watch) | `npm run test:watch` | Run Vitest in watch mode |
| E2E tests | `npm run test:e2e` | Run Playwright browser tests |

## Architecture

Astro handles routing and serves each page as an SSR shell. Each page mounts a single React island via `client:only="react"` that owns all interactivity for that page. The only cross-island boundary is the Header (separate island) communicating with page content through nanostores.

**State is managed in three tiers:**

1. **Nanostores** for global client state (selected catalog, theme). Persisted to localStorage. Shared across React islands because they're plain JS module-level atoms.
2. **TanStack Query** for server state (collections, items, search results). Query keys include the catalog URL, so switching catalogs automatically invalidates stale data.
3. **React Hook Form + Zod** for form state. Schemas define validation rules; converter functions transform between form shape and STAC-compliant JSON.

The API client (`src/lib/stac-api/client.ts`) reads the active catalog from nanostores and provides a typed `stacFetch<T>()` wrapper that all domain functions and query hooks build on.

## STAC API Endpoints

The UI communicates with these STAC API endpoints:

| Method | Path | Operation |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/` | Landing page / API info |
| GET | `/collections` | List collections |
| GET | `/collections/{id}` | Get collection |
| POST | `/collections` | Create collection |
| PUT | `/collections/{id}` | Update collection |
| DELETE | `/collections/{id}` | Delete collection |
| GET | `/collections/{id}/items` | List items (paginated) |
| GET | `/collections/{id}/items/{itemId}` | Get item |
| POST | `/collections/{id}/items` | Create item |
| PUT | `/collections/{id}/items/{itemId}` | Replace item |
| PATCH | `/collections/{id}/items/{itemId}` | Partial update item |
| DELETE | `/collections/{id}/items/{itemId}` | Delete item |
| POST | `/search` | Cross-collection search |

Write operations require the [STAC Transaction Extension](https://github.com/stac-api-extensions/transaction). The included docker-compose backend (`stac-fastapi-pgstac`) has this enabled by default.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
cd app
npm test
```

143 tests across 8 test files covering:
- **Zod schemas** (`schemas.test.ts`): validation of collection and item form data, edge cases for IDs, bbox, provider roles
- **Bbox utilities** (`bbox.test.ts`): coordinate conversion and geometry-to-bbox extraction for all GeoJSON types
- **API client** (`client.test.ts`): URL construction, request headers, error handling for 4xx/5xx, 204 responses
- **Proxy route** (`proxy.test.ts`): header validation, URL scheme checks, request forwarding
- **Extension schemas** (`extensions-schemas.test.ts`): Zod validation, `formToExtensionSchema()` output, round-trips
- **RJSF theme widgets** (`rjsf-theme.test.tsx`): each widget renders correctly, handles changes, disabled states
- **Extension form round-trips** (`extension-roundtrip.test.ts`): `formToStacItem`/`stacItemToForm` and `formToStacCollection`/`stacCollectionToForm` with extension properties

### E2E Tests

```bash
cd app
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright tests covering: catalog management workflow, CORS proxy flow, extension CRUD (create/view/edit/delete), and dynamic extension form rendering. Playwright auto-starts the dev server. A running PostgreSQL database (via `docker compose up -d`) is required for extension-related tests.

## Backend

The `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root starts two services:

- **database**: PostgreSQL 15 with PostGIS and pgstac extensions (port 5433). Also used by the Astro app for extension storage in the `stac_higher` schema.
- **api**: stac-fastapi-pgstac with the Transaction extension enabled (port 8082)

```bash
# Start
docker compose up -d

# Stop
docker compose down

# Stop and remove data
docker compose down -v
```

The frontend does not require the backend to start — it connects to whatever catalog URLs you configure in the UI. The docker-compose setup is provided for local development and testing.
