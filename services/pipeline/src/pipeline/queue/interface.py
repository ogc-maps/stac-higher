"""The queue interface business logic depends on.

Roadmap-locked design (ROADMAP §1 "Topology"): the job queue sits behind an
interface with per-deployment backends — Procrastinate (PostgreSQL
LISTEN/NOTIFY, default) now, SQS in Phase 8. Jobs are batch-oriented: one job
carries N files/items, so the job rate stays low at envelope scale.

Contract notes:

- Handlers are async or sync callables invoked with the payload's keys as
  keyword arguments. Payloads must be JSON-serializable.
- Periodic handlers additionally receive ``timestamp`` (int, unix seconds of
  the scheduled tick) as their first keyword argument.
- ``job_name`` is a stable string identity; the same name must be registered
  on the worker that executes it.
- ``setup()`` is idempotent one-time infrastructure preparation (Procrastinate:
  create/apply its schema; SQS later: validate queue existence).
